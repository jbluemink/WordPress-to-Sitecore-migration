# WordPress-to-Sitecore-migration
Demo how to migrate content to  Sitecore XM Cloud / Sitecore XP from WordPress or Umbraco or basically any CMS that can export the data to a usable format like a JSON file or provide a usable API. By using the The RESTful API for the ItemService

The code works also for Sitecore XP but you need to adjust the template GUID and the template models to fit.
